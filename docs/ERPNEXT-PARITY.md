# Spir-Margin ↔ ERPNext — parity audit

**What this answers:** how closely Spir-Margin mirrors [ERPNext](https://github.com/frappe/erpnext)
in **features** and **look/design**, and exactly what was carried over vs. deliberately left out.

**Honest summary.** ERPNext is a full ERP: **~390 DocTypes** plus the **Frappe framework** (server
controllers in Python, the Desk UI in JS, reports, print formats, workspaces, patches, tests).
Spir-Margin is a **lightweight, domain-focused** re-implementation for medical-device sales, lab
tracking, spare parts and reagent kits. It re-implements the **domain-relevant subset natively**
(Next.js + Postgres) — **~62 DocTypes across 105 tables, 57 migrations, 117 routes** — and wraps it in
an **ERPNext-style "Desk" UI**. It is *not* a 1:1 clone of all of ERPNext, by design. The full ERPNext
source stays public upstream for anything not carried over.

Snapshot: 57 migrations · 105 tables · 117 routes · verified running on embedded Postgres (PGlite).

## Design / look parity (Frappe Desk elements reproduced)

| ERPNext Desk element | Spir-Margin |
| --- | --- |
| Espresso design tokens (ink-gray / surface / InterVariable) | ✅ used throughout (`src/app/globals.css`) |
| Grouped **workspace sidebar** (modules, collapsible) | ✅ `src/components/AppNav.tsx` + `src/lib/nav.ts` |
| **Workspace landing pages** (number cards + shortcuts) | ✅ `src/app/w/[slug]/page.tsx` |
| **Awesomebar** (⌘K global search / new-doc) | ✅ `src/components/desk/Awesomebar.tsx` |
| **List view** (breadcrumb, count, +Add, filter bar) | ✅ `src/components/desk/ListShell.tsx` (primary lists) |
| **Status indicators** (colored dot + label) | ✅ `src/components/desk/Indicator.tsx` |
| **Form view** (breadcrumb, status pill, meta sidebar) | ✅ `src/components/desk/FormShell.tsx` |
| Report view / print formats / desk customization | ➖ not reproduced (Frappe-framework features) |

*List chrome is applied to the primary transactional lists (labs, devices, kits, products, contracts,
appointments, issues, sales-orders, quotations, sales-invoices, purchase-orders, purchase-receipts,
payment-requests, blanket-orders, stock-balance, pick-lists, delivery-trips, opportunities,
work-orders); the remaining lists share the same Espresso card styling.*

### Not portable (Frappe framework)
Server controllers (`*.py`), Desk client scripts (`*.js`), Query/Script **Reports**, **Print Formats**,
**Workspaces** (as data), **Patches**, **Tests**, portal/`www` pages, DocType metadata engine — ⛔ these
run on the Frappe runtime and have no equivalent in a Next.js + SQL stack. Their *behaviour* was
re-expressed as Postgres functions/triggers and React pages where relevant.

## Bottom line
- **Domain features:** the medical-device / lab / kit / spare-part / reagent workflow is covered
  end-to-end — procure (PO / RFQ / blanket order) → **receive (Purchase Receipt → stock)** → QC →
  install/move → maintain → sell → **pick (Pick List) → deliver (Delivery Note / Delivery Trip route)** →
  invoice → **collect (Payment Request → invoice ledger)** — plus CRM, a Stock Balance report, banking
  reconciliation and light accounting.
- **Look & design:** an ERPNext-style Desk (workspaces, awesomebar, list/form shells, status
  indicators) on Frappe's own Espresso tokens.
- **Not carried over (by design):** the ERP-heavy modules (deep accounting, depreciation, shop-floor
  manufacturing, SLA, campaigns, item variants, landed cost, POS, subscriptions) and all
  Frappe-framework machinery. These remain available upstream at
  https://github.com/frappe/erpnext and https://github.com/frappe/frappe.
